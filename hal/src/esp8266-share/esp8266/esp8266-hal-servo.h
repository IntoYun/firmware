//   A servo is activated by creating an instance of the Servo class passing
//   the desired pin to the attach() method.
//   The servos are pulsed in the background using the value most recently
//   written using the write() method.
//
//   This library uses timer0 and timer1.
//   Note that timer0 may be repurposed when the first servo is attached.
//
//   Timers are seized as needed in groups of 12 servos - 24 servos use two
//   timers, there are only two timers for the esp8266 so the support stops here
//   The sequence used to sieze timers is defined in timers.h
//
//   The methods are:
//
//   Servo - Class for manipulating servo motors connected to Arduino pins.
//
//   attach(pin )  - Attaches a servo motor to an i/o pin.
//   attach(pin, min, max  ) - Attaches to a pin setting min and max values in microseconds
//   default min is 544, max is 2400
//
//   write()     - Sets the servo angle in degrees.  (invalid angle that is valid as pulse in microseconds is treated as microseconds)
//   writeMicroseconds() - Sets the servo pulse width in microseconds
//   read()      - Gets the last written servo pulse width as an angle between 0 and 180.
//   readMicroseconds()   - Gets the last written servo pulse width in microseconds. (was read_us() in first release)
//   attached()  - Returns true if there is a servo attached.
//   detach()    - Stops an attached servos from pulsing its i/o pin.
